** Features
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: features
   :END:

Note: this package was formerly called "bibtex-actions."

This package provides a completing-read front-end to browse and act on BibTeX, BibLaTeX, and CSL JSON bibliographic data, and LaTeX, markdown, and org-cite editing support.

When used with vertico, embark, and marginalia, it provides similar functionality to helm-bibtex and ivy-bibtex: quick filtering and selecting of bibliographic entries from the minibuffer, and the option to run different commands against them.

With embark, it also makes available at-point actions in org, markdown, and LaTeX buffers.

Here's a screenshot with [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]] and symbol customization [[https://github.com/bdarcus/citar#icons][noted below]].

#+CAPTION: vertico with citar
[[file:images/vertico.png]]

To see citar in action with org-cite, you can watch [[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/research/][this Emacs Conf 2021 presentation]] by [[https://github.com/rka97][Ahmed Khaled]].

** Installation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installation
   :END:

There are a variety of ways to install citar:

- Doom Emacs :: The easiest way to install and configure citar and related packages is to use the [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/tools/biblio][Doom Emacs biblio module]] with the ~vertico~ completion module.
- MELPA :: citar is also available via [[https://melpa.org/#/citar][MELPA]].
- GUIX :: provides the ~emacs-citar~ package.

In addition, the following packages are strongly recommended for the best experience.

1. [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]] (completion interface)
2. [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]] (completion style)
3. [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]] (contextual actions)
4. [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][Marginalia]] (annotations, and also candidate classification for Embark)

** Configuration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: configuration
   :END:

*** Basic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: basic
    :END:

This is the minimal configuration, and will work with any completing-read compliant vertical completion UI, like Vertico, or the built-in icomplete-vertical, with actions available via =M-x= commands.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package citar
  :bind (("C-c b" . citar-insert-citation)
         :map minibuffer-local-map
         ("M-b" . citar-insert-preset))
  :custom
  (citar-bibliography '("~/bib/references.bib")))
#+END_SRC

*** Embark

Citar will automatically integrate with Embark if it is installed, offering contextual access to actions in the minibuffer and at-point.
When using Embark, the Citar actions are generic, and work the same across org, markdown, and latex modes.

*** Org-Cite

#+CAPTION: org-cite at-point integration with =embark-act=
[[file:images/org-cite-embark-point.png]]

If you want to use Citar only in Org-Mode, this is the best option.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package citar
  :no-require
  :custom
  (org-cite-global-bibliography '("~/bib/references.bib"))
  (org-cite-insert-processor 'citar)
  (org-cite-follow-processor 'citar)
  (org-cite-activate-processor 'citar)
  (citar-bibliography org-cite-global-bibliography)
  ;; optional: org-cite-insert is also bound to C-c C-x C-@
  :bind
  (:map org-mode-map :package org ("C-c b" . #'org-cite-insert)))
#+END_SRC

You can insert citations with the =org-cite-insert= command, which is bound to =C-c C-x C-@= in Org-Mode buffers.  The
optional ~:bind~ command above also gives it the shorter =C-c b= binding.

If you prefer to have the Embark menu open with =org-open-at-point=, you should set this variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq citar-at-point-function 'embark-act)
#+END_SRC

You can invoke both =embark-act= and =embark-dwim=, however, independently of =org-at-point=, and in other modes such as =latex-mode=.

*** Major-mode adapters
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: major-mode-adapters
:END:

Citar includes an adapter framework to enable major-mode specific editing integration.
Such adapters can provide the following capabilities, which one can configure with the ~citar-major-mode-functions~ alist:

1. ~insert-keys~: to insert citation keys (this may go away though)
2. ~insert-citation~: to insert citations
3. ~insert-edit~: to insert citations or edit at point
4. ~local-bib-files~: to find bibliographic files associated with a buffer
5. ~key-at-point~: returns the citation key at point
6. ~citation-at-point~: returns the list of keys in the citation at point

Citar currently includes the following such adapters:

1. ~citar-org~: by default, only supports ~org-cite~, but can one can configure for other formats
2. ~citar-latex~: configurable bibtex, natbib and biblatex support (requires AUCTeX)
3. ~citar-markdown~: by default, only supports the ~pandoc~ citation syntax

None of these should require any configuration, and should load as needed.

** Rich UI
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: rich-ui
:END:

There are three sections of the browsing UI.

1. The prefix, exploiting the affixation feature only available starting with Emacs 28, and holding the symbols to indicate the presence of PDFs or notes associated with the entries.
2. The main display, which by default shows author, title, and date.
3. The suffix, which by default shows citekey, reference type, and (if present) tags or keywords.

You can search against all of the above content.
For the prefix, you can filter for associated files or notes using =has:file= or =has:notes= respectively (and at least with my setup, even the =:p= or =:n= shorthand).

#+CAPTION: UI sections
[[file:images/ui-segments.png]]

*** Templates

The =citar-templates= variable configures formatting for these sections, as well as the default note function.
Here's the default value:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq citar-templates
      '((main . "${author editor:30}     ${date year issued:4}     ${title:48}")
        (suffix . "          ${=key= id:15}    ${=type=:12}    ${tags keywords:*}")
        (preview . "${author editor} (${year issued date}) ${title}, ${journal journaltitle publisher container-title collection-title}.\n")
        (note . "Notes on ${author editor}, ${title}")))
#+END_SRC

Note:

1. You may include multiple variables in a field; the formatter will print the first one it finds.
2. If you plan to use CSL JSON at all, you can and should include CSL JSON variables names where appropriate as such options. The default main template dates field demonstrates this.
3. The asterisk signals to the formatter to use available space for the column.
4. The note template does not take widths, as formatting is inline there rather than columnar.

*** Icons

By default, this UI is plain text, but you can configure it to use icons instead.
Here's how to configure it to use =all-the-icons= as in the screenshot at the top:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq citar-symbols
      `((file ,(all-the-icons-faicon "file-o" :face 'all-the-icons-green :v-adjust -0.1) . " ")
        (note ,(all-the-icons-material "speaker_notes" :face 'all-the-icons-blue :v-adjust -0.3) . " ")
        (link ,(all-the-icons-octicon "link" :face 'all-the-icons-orange :v-adjust 0.01) . " ")))
(setq citar-symbol-separator "  ")
#+END_SRC

** Test Script
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: test-script
    :END:

The repository =test= directory also includes a script you can use to run this and associated packages in the =emacs -Q= sandbox.
To do that, simply run =./run.sh= from the =test= directory.
By default, this will use selectrum as the completion system.
If you would like to try vertico instead, just do =M-x vertico-mode=.

** History and predefined searches
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: history-and-predefined-searches
    :END:

=citar= has functionality similar to the [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex#p][predefined search]] functionality in =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex=, but with a different implementation.
Rather than create a new command with the search terms as argument, you just set the =citar-presets= variable, and add the strings you want to access:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq citar-presets '("one search string" "another search string"))
#+end_src

You then have two ways to access these strings from the completion prompt:

1. by using =M-n= from the prompt, which will cycle through the strings
2. by calling =citar-insert-preset= with a keybinding, and then selecting the string

=citar= also preserves the history of your selections (see caveat below about multiple candidate selection though), which are also accessible in your completion UI, but by using =M-p=.
You can save this history across sessions by adding =citar-history= to =savehist-additional-variables=.

** Refreshing the library display
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: refreshing-the-library-display
    :END:

=citar= uses two caches to speed up library display; one for the global bibliography, and another for local files specific to a buffer.
This is great for performance, but means the data can become stale if you modify it.

The =citar-refresh= command will reload the caches, and you can call this manually.
You can also call any of the =citar= commands with a prefix argument: =C-u M-x citar-insert-key=.

Although not default, =citar= also provides convenience functions for auto-refreshing cache when bib files change using filenotify.
The simplest use of this functionality is

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(citar-filenotify-setup '(LaTeX-mode-hook org-mode-hook))
#+END_SRC

This will add watches for the global bib files and in addition add a hook to =LaTeX-mode-hook= and =org-mode-hook= to add watches for local bibliographic files.
By default this will invalidate the cache if a bib file changes. If the bib files change rarely, a more suitable option is to refresh the cache.
This can be achieved by

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq citar-filenotify-callback 'refresh-cache)
#+END_SRC

The behavior can be tweaked more thoroughly by setting ~citar-filenotify-callback~ to a function.
See its documentation for details.
Watches can be also placed on additional files.
This is controlled by the variable ~citar-filenotify-files~.

Another option to make the completion interface more seamless is to add a hook which generates the cache after a buffer is opened.
This can be done when emacs has been idle (half a second in the example below) with something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun gen-bib-cache-idle ()
  "Generate bib item caches with idle timer"
  (run-with-idle-timer 0.5 nil #'citar-refresh))

(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'gen-bib-cache-idle)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'gen-bib-cache-idle)
#+END_SRC

For additional configuration options on this, see [[https://github.com/bdarcus/citar/wiki/Configuration#automating-path-watches][the wiki]].

** Notes

Citar provides a ~citar-create-note-function~ variable, and a default function for org, which also works well with org-roam (v2 now supports org-cite).
You can configure the title display using the "note" template.

You can also use the ~citar-open-note-functions~ variable to replace or augment the default with another; for example from org-roam-bibtex:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq citar-open-note-functions '(orb-citar-edit-note))
#+END_SRC

Since ~citar-open-note-functions~ is a list, you can also include multiple functions, to handle different note scenarios.

Please note that if you choose to use org-roam-bibtex using the above configuration, you will need to set ~:immediate-finish t~ in the template that you use for bibliography notes in ~org-roam-capture-templates~.
Since ~citar-open-note-functions~ attempts multiple functions one after the other, this is needed to ensure the ~org-capture~ returns immediately without waiting for further user input.

Citar also includes a ~citar-has-notes-functions~ variable, which specifies a list of functions, each of which returns a predicate function to test whether a reference has associated notes.
This function allows Citar to correctly format the completion UI candidates.
The default function only supports one-file-per-key notes.

** Files, file association and file-field parsing

If you have ~citar-library-paths~ set, the relevant open commands will look in those directories for file names of =CITEKEY.EXTENSION=.
They will also parse contents of a file-field.
The ~citar-file-parser-functions~ variable governs which parsers to use, and there are two included parsers:

1. The default =citar-file-parser-default= parser works for simple colon or semi-colon-delimited lists of file paths, as in Zotero.
2. The =citar-file-parser-triplet= works for Mendeley and Calibre, which represent files using a format like =:/path/file.pdf:PDF=.

If you have a mix of entries created with Zotero and Calibre, you can set it like so and it will parse both:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq citar-file-parser-functions
  '(citar-file-parser-default
    citar-file-parser-triplet))
#+END_SRC

The ~citar-file-extensions~ variable governs which file extensions the open commands will recognize.

The =citar-open-library-files= command includes an optional file browser, which can be set with the ~citar-file-open-prompt~ boolean variable.
When used with embark and consult, you will have a range of alternate actions available for the candidates.

#+CAPTION: File candidates with embark options
[[file:images/file-browser-embark.png]]

*** BibTeX Crossref File Support

For BibTeX entries that have a 'crossref' field, Citar will associate the entry's key with the resources (files, notes, links) that are associated with the cross-referenced entry.

For example: consider an entry for "Baym1965" that has a 'crossref' field "Meyers1999". When citar-open is called and "Baym1965" is selected, the minibuffer will list all files, notes, and links associated with both "Baym1965" and "Meyers1999". The proper prefixes, denoting an associated file, note, or link, will also be listed with each candidate in the minibuffer.

NOTE: For the BibTeX crossref feature to work properly, the entry with the 'crossref' field must come *before* the cross-referenced entry in the bib file. (This is a requirement of BibTeX, not of Citar specifically.) In the example above, then, the entry for "Baym1965" must come before the entry for "Meyers1999".

** Usage
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: usage
   :END:

You have a few different ways to use citar.

*** Org-cite

Citar includes an org-cite =citar= processor, with "insert," "activate" and "follow" capabilities.

The "insert processor" uses =citar-select-refs= to browse your library to insert and edit citations and citation references using the =org-cite-insert= command.
The command is context-aware, so depending on where point is in the buffer, will behave differently.
For example, if point:

- precedes the colon, you will be prompted to edit the style
- is on an existing citation-reference, you will be prompted to replace it
- follows or precedes a citation-reference, you will be prompted to add a new citation-reference

The "activate processor" runs the list of functions in ~citar-org-activation-functions~, which by default is the ~basic~ processor from ~oc-basic~ to provide fontification, and also a little function that adds a keymap for editing citations at point.
That keymap includes the following bindings that provide additional citation and citation-reference editing options.

| key         | binding                        |
|-------------+--------------------------------|
| C-c C-x DEL | oc-citar-delete-citation       |
| C-c C-x k   | oc-citar-kill-citation         |
| S-<left>    | oc-citar-shift-reference-left  |
| S-<right>   | oc-citar-shift-reference-right |
| M-p         | oc-citar-update-pre-suffix     |
| <mouse-1>   | citar-dwim                     |
| <mouse-3>   | embark-act                     |


The "follow processor" provides at-point functionality accessible via the =org-open-at-point= command.
By default, in org-mode with org-cite support, when point is on a citation or citation-reference, and you invoke =org-open-at-point=, it will run the default command, which is =citar-open=.
Changing this value to =embark-act= with embark installed and configured will provide access to the standard citar commands at point.

Org-cite citations include optional "styles" and "variants" to locally modify the citation rendering.
When inserting a new citation, calling =org-cite-insert= with a prefix arg will prompt to select a style.
To edit an existing citation's style, just make sure point is on the citation prefix before running =org-cite-insert=, and you will get a list of available styles.
That list is based on your configuration; if you have the =oc-natbib= and =oc-csl= processors configured, for example, the list will include the styles and variants available in those two processors.
The variants included in the bundled processors include the following, with the shortcuts in parentheses:

- =bare= (=b=): without surrounding punctuation
- =caps= (=c=): force initial capitalization
- =full= (=f=): ignore et al shortening for author names

Generally, you shouldn't need these, but they can be useful in certain circumstances.
If an export processor doesn't support a specific variant for a specific style, it should just fallback to the base style.
For example, if you specify =text/f=, and the export processor you use doesn't support the =f= variant there, it should just output as if you specified =text=.

*** =M-x=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: m-x
    :END:

Simply do =M-x= and select the command that you want, enter the terms to find the item you are looking for, and hit return.
This runs the default action: the command you invoked.

*** Access an alternate action via =embark-act=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: access-an-alternate-action-via-embark-act
    :END:

If while browsing you instead would rather edit that record, and you have embark installed and configured, this is where =embark-act= comes in.
Simply input the keybinding for =embark-act= (in my case =C-o=), and select the alternate action.

*** Use =embark-collect-snapshot=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: use-embark-collect-snapshot
    :END:

A final option, that can be useful: run =embark-collect-snapshot= (=S=) from =embark-act=.
This will select the candidate subset, and open it in a separate buffer.
From there, you can run the same options discussed above using =embark-act= (which is also bound to =a= in the collect buffer).

So, for example, say you are working on a paper. You hold the complete super-set of items you are interested in citing at some point in that buffer.
From there, you can run different actions on the candidates at will, rather than search individually for each item you want to cite.

*** Use =citar-dwim=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: use-citar-dwim
    :END:

=M-x citar-dwim= will run the default action on citation keys found at point directly.
If you have =embark= installed, you use can =embark-dwim= instead for the same behavior, and =embark-act= for additional actions at-point.

If no citation key is found, the minibuffer will open for selection.
You can disable this behavior by setting =citar-at-point-fallback= to nil.

** Comparisons
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: comparisons
   :END:

To understand how citar compares to other packages like =org-ref=, =ivy-bibtex= and =helm-bibtex= (and the related =bibtex-completion=), see the [[https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar/wiki/Comparisons][comparisons]] page on the wiki.

** Acknowledgements
   :PROPERTIES:

The ideas in this project were initially worked out in a [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex/issues/353][conversation]] with [[https://github.com/mtreca][Maxime Tréca]] and [[https://github.com/minad][Daniel Mendler]].
Daniel, author of [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] and [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][marginalia]], helped us understand the possibilities of the new suite of completing-read packages, while Maxime came up with an [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex/pull/355][initial prototype]].

This code takes those ideas and re-implements them to fill out the feature set, and also optimize the code clarity and performance.
